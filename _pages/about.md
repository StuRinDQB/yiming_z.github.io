This is Yiming Zeng, a PhD Candidate in Computer Science from University of Connecticut. I received my M.S. in Information Science from University of Pittsburgh in 2023 and B.E. in Information System in 2020. I used to be a software engineer in Baidu and researcher in UPMC Hillman Cancer Center.

News
======
1. [August, 2025] ðŸŽ† Excited to share that my first-author paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Bridging the Editing Gap in LLMs: FineEdit for Precise and Targeted Text Modifications"</a> has been accepted to EMNLP 2025 (a top conference in AI and NLP)! Huge thanks to my amazing collaborators ðŸ™Œ. In this work, we bridge the gap between large language models and fine-grained editing needs. We design an automated pipeline to construct comprehensive instruction-based editing datasets, and introduce FineEdit, a state-of-the-art model that sets new benchmarks for precise and targeted text editing.

2. [April, 2025] ðŸŽ‰ I have passed the PhD Qualifying Exam and become a PhD Candidate in Computer Science.

3. [August, 2024] I relocated from Pittsburgh to Connecticut to pursue my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Connecticut, and I am grateful to be working under the guidance of Dr. Tingting Yu.

4. [July, 2024] Our paper <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38313267/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"reguloGPT: Harnessing GPT for Knowledge Graph Construction of Molecular Regulatory Pathways"</a>  has been accepted by IEEE BHI 2024. This is one of my major work in UPMC Hillman Cancer Center under the supervision of Dr. Yufei Huang.

Project Experience
======
<a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2508.01473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"TreeDiff: AST-Guided Code Generation with Diffusion LLMs"</a> â€” *Research Project*
- Developed a **syntax-aware diffusion framework** for code generation by integrating **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)** into the denoising process, ensuring syntactic correctness.  
- Trained on **150K code reasoning samples** with **8 Ã— 100 A100 GPUs**, achieving a **+4.27% pass@1 improvement on HumanEval** compared to baseline models.  
- Demonstrated that **structural priors** significantly enhance diffusion-based LLMs in program synthesis, with potential applications in **software engineering** and **developer tools**.  


Industry Experience
======
### Hospital Survey System â€” *UPMC Hillman Cancer Center*
- Designed and deployed a hospital survey platform using **MVC architecture**, enabling researchers to efficiently create and manage surveys.  
- Built an interactive survey editor with **React Hooks**, **TypeScript**, and **Ant Design**, including a drag-and-drop feature for intuitive customization.  
- Developed a scalable backend with **Express.js** and RESTful APIs to support CRUD operations for surveys, responses, and admin controls.  
- Optimized **MongoDB schemas** with indexing strategies, improving query performance by **40%** and supporting large-scale survey response storage.

### Switch System Development â€” *Cisco-Inspur*
- Implemented an authentication module with **Spring Boot + JPA**, streamlining user verification for enterprise switch systems.  
- Applied **asynchronous processing (@Async)** to handle user data, improving authentication efficiency by **30%**.  
- Enhanced MAC address verification for **voice phone authentication** using regex-based validation, reducing mismatches and errors.  
- Added **pagination** across controller, service, and repository layers for scalable MAC address retrieval, reducing query load and improving performance on large datasets.  

Teaching Experience
======
**Adjunct Lecturer â€” CSE2102 (University of Connecticut)**  
- Taught *React.js* fundamentals (Hooks, state management, component-based UI design).  
- Guided students in deploying full-stack projects (**React frontend + Express backend**) to AWS.
