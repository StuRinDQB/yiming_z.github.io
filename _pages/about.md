This is Yiming Zeng, a PhD Candidate in Computer Science from University of Connecticut. I received my M.S. in Information Science from University of Pittsburgh in 2023 and B.E. in Information System in 2020. I used to be a software engineer in Baidu and researcher in UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. 

I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Tingting Yu and deeply appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Shangqian Gao on exploring large language models (LLMs).

My area of interests lie in Large Language Models especially in Model Training, Efficient LLMs, and AI for Code Generation. If you are interest in colloration with me, please email yiming.zeng@uconn.edu.
